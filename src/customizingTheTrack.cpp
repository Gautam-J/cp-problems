Highway 201 is the most busy street in Rockport. Traffic cars cause a lot of hindrances to races, especially when there are a lot of them. The track which passes through this highway can be divided into n sub-tracks. You are given an array a where ai represents the number of traffic cars in the i-th sub-track. You define the inconvenience of the track as ∑i=1n∑j=i+1n|ai−aj|, where |x| is the absolute value of x.

You can perform the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times: choose a traffic car and move it from its current sub-track to any other sub-track.

Find the minimum inconvenience you can achieve.

Input
The first line of input contains a single integer t (1≤t≤10000) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1≤n≤2⋅105).

The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (0≤ai≤109).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105.

Output
For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer: the minimum inconvenience you can achieve by applying the given operation any (possibly zero) number of times.

Note
For the first test case, you can move a car from the 3-rd sub-track to the 1-st sub-track to obtain 0 inconvenience.

For the second test case, moving any car won't decrease the inconvenience of the track
